# Raspberry Pi Info Gui - v1.0.0
The Raspberry Pi Info Gui is a simple program made in Python using Tkinter that displays a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays some basic information about the user's Raspberry Pi. The information shown is:
### Hardware
- CPU Temperature
- Raspberry Pi Model (Revision)
### Network Information
- Hostname
- IP Address
- SSID

RPiInfoGui uses Python 2 and up, as well as [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). As of now, this has been tested on the following Raspberry Pi Models:

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (a02082)

If you have run this successfully on your Raspberry Pi of a different Model or Revision, please commit to the README.md file with your revision version.
